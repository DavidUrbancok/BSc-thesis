Working with Complex SQL Queries in Unit Tests

The aim of this thesis is to analyze and extend the existing support of faking _Info_ and _InfoProvider_ objects in unit tests with complex SQL queries. The result will be a working prototype and the analysis of saved time by rewriting integration tests to unit tests.

Assignment:
* Familiarize with the current implementation of chosen mocked objects (Info and InfoProvider) in automated integration tests in Kentico CMS.
* Analyze its insufficiency and options of extension to unit tests with complex SQL queries.
* Propose a suitable prototype and method of rewriting integration tests to unit tests.
* Implement this prototype to Kentico CMS.
* Compare this prototype with the original solution and evaluate its acquisition.
* Suggest other solutions and extensions in the future.
